class BasicAgent(client.Agent):
    """ Returns a Deferred which contains a BasicResponse
    Asynchronous HTTP Client Helper which makes some assumptions to satisfy the
    majority of use cases. See: twisted.web.iweb.IAgent for the details of
    the Agent interface.

    - The deferred object waits for headers and the body to be delivered
    before firing. It's result MUST be a Response object.
    - The data attached to the request MUST be a string. Unicode is never valid.
    The producer on the client will wrap the string.
    - Headers MUST be a twisted.web.client.Headers object
    - All semantics of the underlying agent also apply
        - See: twisted.web.iweb.IAgent
    - Provides a "requests" like interface

    requests and so a stub agent should be used. For integration testing use a
    live agent.

    The stub agent collects requests in the order in which they are made. This
    allows easy access to iteratively respond to the requests in an ordered manner.

    Requests can only have one response or failure instance applied so a queue
    is constructed to track which requests have already been acted upon.

    The second tool is "live replay". All recorded requests are performed on a
    live agent. The response to each request is stored in a live_request_history.
    This is useful for recording the current state and behaivor of an external
    api. The live replay is a good tool for generating mocks or scheama but
    again it should not be used for integration testing.
